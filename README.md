# CodeOptimization

This repository documents improvments of a code snippet allegedly written by another programmer and how to make code optimizations.
This project was the last assignment in Computer Structure course I took as part of Computer Science degree in Bar-Ilan university.

The scenario is as follows:
We are given a code snippet of another programmer and our goal is to optimize his runtime as much as possible using all the tools and principles we learned in the course. The goal is to get to a run time of the program fast As much as possible. This is a competition betwee students in which the students receive grades in relation to the performance achieved by their peers. The shorter the runtime of the code, the higher the student score (And of course the code should perform the same task performed by the original code).

Note: The only file we were allowed to modify is _c.myfunction_ only.
